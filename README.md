# SeafoodTrackathon
  <p><strong><em>Is your seafood traceable?</em></strong></p>
  
### Hackathon Location

<p>GS1 Germany Knowledge Center Rooms: Cologne & Tokyo
Address:
Stolberger Str. 108, 50933 Cologne, Germany</p>


<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what's in your fishstick? Was that salmon caught in Alaska and processed in China? Do you know the story of how your tuna was caught, canned and then made its way to your dinner table?</p>
<p>Global Dialogue members (fishers, processors, and retailers) are shifting the market towards traceability systems that enable tracking seafood from vessel to plate. They are developing industry standards in a pre-competitive environment that include solutions for small- and large-scale actors alike. The key element is linking traceability systems so they can seamlessly communicate with each other. Interoperable traceability will mean we know when, where, how and by whom the seafood we consume is caught, processed and shipped.</p>
<p>We need your expertise in designing technical solutions to capture data, creative ways to share that data, and strategies to convert data seamlessly. Ultimately, with your help we will make progress towards connecting the seafood industry to make sure we can answer these questions accurately in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Hacking Seafood Traceabilty</strong></p>
<p>The Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (GDST) brings the seafood industry together to design the standards for interoperable seafood traceability. Only when the industry has aligned on how to trace seafood along the supply chain and works in unison with a common standard that allows systems to communicate with each other, will you be able to answer those questions.</p>
<p>On 10-12 February 2019, the GDST is hosting a Seafood Traceability Hackathon (Seafood Trackathon). Its mission is to promote seafood traceability and interoperability by sharing the standards and methods developed by the GDST with the seafood industry's technical community. Interoperability requires communication between and among seafood companies, retailers, brokers, processors and IT system providers that support them.</p>
<p><strong>Networking Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>This hackathon offers a unique experience to interact with and learn from the seafood industry, traceability and technical experts, and of course coders, developers, data scientists and conceptual thinkers. Through knowledge sharing, interdisciplinary teams will use real data sets taken from industry supply chains to develop solutions which address tools and applications to capture data on fishing vessels, conceptualize feasible data sharing options and develop creative ways to define data formats that support interoperability amongst seafood traceability systems.</p>
<p>Teams will have the opportunity to work on challenges in the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>#1 Data Capture: </strong>create web and mobile examples of data capture applications based on GDST Critical Tracking Events and Key Data Elements - output to a seafood pedigree file in GDST prescribed format. </p>
<p><strong>#2 Data Sharing: </strong>develop innovative ways to share seafood pedigree files, including decentralized ledger technology. </p>
<p><strong>#3 File Conversion Tools: </strong>develop tools to convert from spreadsheets, text files and paper records into GDST seafood pedigree files. </p>
<p><strong>#4 Catch Area Zero Knowledge Proof: </strong>develop an innovative, feasible technological framework for establishing location legality without disclosing actual geo-coordinates to unauthorized entities. </p>
<p><strong>#5 Non-GS1 Identifiers: </strong>develop intuitive, easy to use solutions for interoperability between GS1 and non-GS1 keys.</p>
<p>To help you with the development of your solution, you can select one of the problem statement as a specific application of your solution. Each problem statement addresses at least one of the categories above.</p>
